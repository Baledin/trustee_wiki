<p>An informal AGO Opinion issued 4/2/1952, signed by Assistant Attorney General Lyle L. Iversen and addressed to Maryan E. Reynolds, Washington State Librarian, states:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;It is our conclusion that property purchased by a rural county library district or an intercounty rural library district should be held in the name of the district and not that of the county&hellip; Rural county library districts and intercounty rural library districts are municipal corporations in their own right. As such they are authorized to acquire property and hold it in their own names. It is our opinion that such districts in acquiring property should take title in their own names and not in the names of the counties in which they lie.&rdquo;</blockquote>
