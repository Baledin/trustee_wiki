Public libraries should follow the [https://www.sos.wa.gov/archives/recordsmanagement/managing-library-district-records.aspx|Local Government Common Records Retention Schedule (CORE) v. 4.0] (May 2017). Librarians should take note of section 5.2 which specifically addresses library services.

The following sections may be relevant for libraries:
* Bank records, see page 103
* Vouchers, see pages 96-97
* Payroll, see section 3.5 beginning on page 105
* Board minutes, see section 1.10 beginning on page 37.    

Records consultants at the Washington State Archives will help narrow that down to specific DANs for categories of records which are not immediately obvious.
