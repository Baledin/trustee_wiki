<p>&ldquo;Yes. <a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/ago-opinions/ability-library-charge-library-services" target="_blank" class="externallink">AGO 1992 No. 31</a> reviews this issue, noting that basic library services must be provided free of charge to residents of the political jurisdiction which supports the library through taxation. The corollary is that public libraries can charge user fees to those who do not live within the jurisdiction which provides the tax revenues to pay for the library. In fact, if a public library provides services to non-residents without charging a fee, an argument can be made that the library is violating the &quot;gift clause&quot; of the <a href="http://leg.wa.gov/LawsAndAgencyRules/Pages/constitution.aspx" target="_blank" class="externallink">Washington State Constitution</a>.

Libraries can charge for ancillary services such as copying machines, phones, fax machines, etc. - that issue is also covered in the AGO.&rdquo;</p>
