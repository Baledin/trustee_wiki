<p>An informal AGO Opinion issued 1/27/1982, signed by Assistant Attorney General Thomas R. Bjorgen and addressed to Nancy Zussy, states:
<blockquote>&ldquo;You have inquired whether a person residing in an incorporated part of a county may sit on the board of trustees of an intercounty rural library district&hellip; In AGLO 1973 No. 67â€¦ a similar question was posed regarding rural county library districts. That opinion held, in sum, that&hellip; it is not necessary that a trustee of a rural county library district be a resident of the unincorporated area of the county. This reasoning applies with equal force to intercounty rural library districts.&ldquo;</blockquote>
