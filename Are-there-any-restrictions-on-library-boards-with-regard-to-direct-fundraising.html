<p>Lawyers at MRSC could find nothing that would prohibit a <strong><u>district</u></strong> library from direct fundraising and cited the following phrases from [RCW-27-12-210|RCW 27.12.210], which they felt gave trustees broad authorization to do what is necessary to maintain a library:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(5) &ldquo;Have exclusive control of the finances of the library;</li>
  <li>(6) Accept such gifts of money or property for library purposes as they deem expedient;</li>
  <li>(10) Do all other acts necessary for the orderly and efficient management and control of the library.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>However, they believed that a library under a city might be prohibited by city rules, although they were unable to find the same constraint for a self-governing library district.</p>
