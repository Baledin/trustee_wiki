<p>An informal AGO Opinion issued 3/7/1991, signed by Assistant Attorney General Carole A. Ressler and addressed to Martin Muench, states:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;You have asked whether, under <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=27.12.190" target="_blank" class="externallink">RCW 27.12.190</a>, a Library Trustee who is appointed to complete another Trustee&apos;s term can then serve two consecutive full terms&hellip; The Trustee who fills an unexpired term is not serving &lsquo;a term&rsquo; as defined in the statute. Under this analysis, a Trustee can serve two terms in addition to completing another&apos;s unexpired term&hellip; Filling a vacancy is different from &lsquo;regular&rsquo; appointments made by the appointing authority. That distinction provides additional support for interpreting the limitation to apply to &lsquo;regular&rsquo; appointments: two consecutive full terms as defined in the statute.&rdquo;</blockquote>
