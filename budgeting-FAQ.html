    <p>Is there a taxing authority for a noncharter city library?</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In response to this question, a Legal Consultant from MRSC had the following response:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, there is no taxing authority for a noncharter city library. The city library is a general fund responsibility, so unless the citizens vote to raise the property tax rate, the library has to be funded out of the city&rsquo;s current budget. <nowiki>[A library district does have taxing authority, but a city does not.]</nowiki> Here is the funding authorization established for local libraries ([RCW-27-12-240|RCW 27.12.240]):</p>
    <blockquote>After a library shall have been established or library service contracted for, the legislative body of the governmental unit for which the library was established or the service engaged, shall appropriate money annually for the support of the library. All funds for the library, whether derived from taxation or otherwise, shall be in the custody of the treasurer of the governmental unit, and shall be designated by him in some manner for identification, and shall not be used for any but library purposes. The board of trustees shall have the exclusive control of expenditures for library purposes subject to any examination of accounts required by the state and money shall be paid for library purposes only upon vouchers of the board of trustees, without further audit. The board shall not make expenditures or incur indebtedness in any year in excess of the amount of money appropriated and/or available for library purposes.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>Could a city give nondesignated funds (e.g., log forest &ldquo;windfall&rdquo; monies) to the library?</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>[RCW-35-22-280|RCW 35.22.280(19)] allows for a city to include language in its charter that would permit this.</p>

    <p>After the library&rsquo;s budget is approved, is the library director free to allocate funds as he or she sees fit?</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Once the budget is adopted by the board or approved by the city authorities, the director has the authority to allocate funds within the budget allotment to accomplish the plan, though it is the responsibility of the director to discuss with the board or city authorities any significant budget revisions that may be necessary. </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <p>What role does the library board play in the budget?</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Trustees are legally responsible for the finances of the library. ([RCW-27-12-240|RCW 27.12.240]) To carry out that responsibility, they both monitor the broad financial picture and authorize payment of funds that have been approved for library purposes. To oversee library finances adequately, the board should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read all materials related to the budget closely;</li>
      <li>Ask questions;</li>
      <li>Look for variances;</li>
      <li>Make comparisons;</li>
      <li>Ensure there are adequate reasons for any apparent contradictions;</li>
      <li>Pay attention to any audits and attendant recommendations, thus maintaining its own as well as the library&rsquo;s fiscal integrity.</li>

  <dt>
    <p>What is the role of the library director in helping the board to monitor the budget?</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>To facilitate the board&rsquo;s monitoring of library finances, the director must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Present them with financial statements that the library board and other constituencies can understand;</li>
      <li>Provide them with monthly financial reports that include:</li>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>Year-to-date revenues and expenditures compared to initial projections;</li>

    <p>Who oversees a library capital facility area?</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The governing body consists of 3 members of the county legislative authority from each county in which the area is located. If a county has more than 3 members of their legislative body, the 3 persons to serve on governing body of the library capital facility area are chosen by the full membership of the county legislative authority. Where the library capital facility area is located in more than one county, a county may be represented by less than 3 members by mutual agreement of the legislative authorities of the participating counties.

    <p>Do nonprofit organizations pay or charge sales tax on their purchases or sales in Washington?</p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The Washington State Department of Revenue responds in the following <a href="http://dor.wa.gov/content/QuestionsAndAnswers/article.aspx?id=10163&amp;cNode=6L6I3Y" target="_blank" class="externallink">FAQ</a>:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Generally, nonprofit organizations must pay retail sales tax on all purchases of tangible personal property and must collect retail sales tax on their sales of such items. However, nonprofits conducting qualifying fundraising activities may purchase goods and services that will be resold at such events without paying sales tax by providing a reseller permit to the seller. Additionally, the income generated from qualifying fundraising event is not subject to either retail sales tax or the business and occupation tax.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=458-20-169" target="_blank" class="externallink">WAC 458-20-169</a>, in discussing fund-raising activities that would not be tax-exempt, states:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;(iv) Nonqualifying activities. Fund-raising activity <strong>does not include the operation of a regular place of business</strong> in which services are provided or sales are made during regular hours such as a bookstore, thrift shop, restaurant, legal or health clinic, or similar business. It also does not include the operation of a regular place of business from which services are provided or performed during regular hours such as the provision of retail, personal, or professional services. A regular place of business and the regular hours of that business depend on the type of business being conducted.</p>
    <p>(v) Fund-raising sales by libraries. <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.04.3651" target="_blank" class="externallink">RCW 82.04.3651</a> specifically provides that <strong>the sale of used books, used videos, used sound recording, or similar used information products in a library is not the operation of a regular place of business, if the proceeds are used to support the library</strong>. The library must be a free public library supported in whole or in part with money derived from taxes. [RCW-27-12-010|RCW 27.12.010].&rdquo;</p>

    <p><a href="http://mrsc.org/Home/Research-Tools/Ask-MRSC-Archives/Finance.aspx" target="_blank" class="externallink">MRSC</a> posts the following response:<br />
      Reviewed: 12/13</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Every city and town in the state has the authority to accept donations. There is no specific process set out in state law, and a public hearing is not required before the donation can be accepted.</p>
    <p><a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=35.21.100" target="_blank" class="externallink">RCW 35.21.100</a> provides:</p>
    <p>Every city and town by ordinance may accept any money or property donated, devised, or bequeathed to it and carry out the terms of the donation, devise, or bequest, if within the powers granted by law. If no terms or conditions are attached to the donation, devise, or bequest, the city or town may expend or use it for any municipal purpose.</p>
    <p>Although this language can reasonably be interpreted to mean that a city must pass an ordinance to accept each and every donation it receives, many cities interpret it to mean that the city must establish by ordinance a procedure for accepting donations. Some cities authorize a particular city official, such as a clerk-treasurer or city manager/administrator, to accept donations on behalf of the city. Others provide that the council will do so, and, unless specified, that could be done by motion or resolution.</p>
    <p>In the absence of a delegation of authority to accept donations, we recommend, at a minimum, that the city council pass a motion or resolution accepting the donation.&rdquo;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>(5) &ldquo;Have exclusive control of the finances of the library;</li>
      <li>(6) Accept such gifts of money or property for library purposes as they deem expedient;</li>
      <li>(10) Do all other acts necessary for the orderly and efficient management and control of the library.&rdquo;</li>

The corollary is that public libraries can charge user fees to those who do not live within the jurisdiction which provides the tax revenues to pay for the library.
