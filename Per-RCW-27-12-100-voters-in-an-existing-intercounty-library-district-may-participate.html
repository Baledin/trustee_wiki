<p>An informal AGO Opinion issued 5/5/1987, signed by Assistant Attorney General Jerri Thomas and addressed to Mary Y. Moore, states:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;You have also asked whether the original district would automatically dissolve if the voters, using the petition/election method, turned down the proposal for an expanded district&hellip; In my opinion, the original district would not dissolve even if the expanded district vote was negative. The existing district would remain intact following a negative vote on expanding the district.&rdquo;</blockquote>
