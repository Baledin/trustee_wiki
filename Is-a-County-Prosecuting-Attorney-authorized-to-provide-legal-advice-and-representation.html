<p>An informal AGO Opinion issued 11/12/1976, signed by Deputy Attorney General Philip H. Austin and addressed to Jeffrey C. Sullivan, states:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Your question is answered in the negative&mldr; This office <nowiki>[has]</nowiki> characterized a rural county library district as an independent political subdivision rather than, merely, a county agency&mldr; We concluded that the prosecuting attorney was required to provide legal representation <nowiki>[to]</nowiki> county agencies rather than independent municipal corporations&mldr; Those duties and functions do not include that of providing legal counsel and representation to a library district.&rdquo;</blockquote>
