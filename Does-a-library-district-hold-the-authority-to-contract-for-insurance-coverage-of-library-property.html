<p>An informal AGO Opinion issued 6/6/1975, signed by Assistant Attorney General Wayne L. Williams and addressed to Maryan E. Reynolds, states:</p>
<blockquote>&quot;It would seem to me to be a prudent and perhaps very nearly necessary part of the care of the property of a library, to insure that property against loss. For this reason, it is my view that one may safety imply from the language contained in [RCW-27-12-210|RCW 27.12.210] the necessary power to secure such insurance coverage&hellip; It would appear to be reasonable for the district to exercise that power to employ an insurance broker if the district felt the need for expert advice as to the acquisition of such coverage.&quot;</blockquote>
