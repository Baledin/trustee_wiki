<p>An informal AGO Opinion issued 4/18/1992, signed by Assistant Attorney General Jean M. Wilkerson and addressed to Mary Y. Moore, states:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;There is a conflict between RCW 27.12.210 and Title 35A RCW, and the provisions of Title 35A RCW prevail. Therefore, the city council sets the library director&rsquo;s salary in a non-charter code city. However, so long as the city council has the final say, the council may delegate to the library trustees a role in the matter of setting the library director&rsquo;s compensation&mldr; With respect to a charter code city, the city council will set the library director&rsquo;s compensation, unless the charter provides for something different.&rdquo;</blockquote>
