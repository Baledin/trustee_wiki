<p>This chapter addresses laws that relate to public records in libraries. Many general questions can be answered by consulting the in-depth resource, <a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/open-government-resource-manual" target="_blank" class="externallink"><em>Open Government Resource Manual</em></a>, which cites the laws and subsequent legal interpretations. Specific questions should be addressed to your library&rsquo;s legal counsel.</p>
<p>In 1972, the voters in the state of Washington adopted Initiative 276, which requires that most records maintained by state, county, and city governments, and by all special purpose districts, be made available to members of the public.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/open-government-resource-manual/chapter-1" target="_blank" class="externallink">Open Government Resource Manual, Chapter 1</a>:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;The Public Records Act (&ldquo;PRA&rdquo; or &ldquo;Act&rdquo;) was enacted by initiative to provide the people with broad rights of access to public records. The Act declares that it must be &lsquo;liberally construed&rsquo; to promote the public policy of open government.</blockquote>
<p>The Public Disclosure Act (now referred to as the Public Records Act, <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56&amp;full=true" target="_blank" class="externallink">RCW 42.56</a>), along with the Open Public Meetings Act (&ldquo;OPMA&rdquo;), <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.30&amp;full=true" target="_blank" class="externallink">RCW 42.30</a>, addressed requirements for state and local governmental units to conduct open public meetings and to provide public access to their records. The <a href="http://www.pdc.wa.gov" target="_blank" class="externallink">Public Disclosure Commission</a> is responsible for providing information about the RCW&rsquo;s as well as ensuring compliance.</p>
<p>The following statement from <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.030" target="_blank" class="externallink">RCW 42.56.030</a> demonstrates the clear intent of the law and the manner in which courts have interpreted the law:</p>
<blockquote>The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created. This chapter shall be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed to promote this public policy and to assure that the public interest will be fully protected in the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other act, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.550" target="_blank" class="externallink">RCW 42.56.550(3)</a> emphasizes this by stating:</p>
<blockquote><em>Courts shall take into account the policy&hellip; that free and open examination of public records is in the public interest, even though such examination may cause inconvenience or embarrassment to public officials or others&hellip;</em></blockquote>
<p>Because the public records disclosure statutes are sometimes difficult to interpret and are often a source of litigation, the Municipal Research and Services Center (MRSC) has prepared a publication, <em><a href="http://mrsc.org/getmedia/796a2402-9ad4-4bde-a221-0d6814ef6edc/Public-Records-Act.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf" target="_blank" class="externallink">Public Records Act for Washington Cities, Counties, and Special Purpose Districts</a></em>, which reviews all of the relevant statutes, exemptions and prohibitions to disclosure, and procedures to be followed when handling a request for disclosure. Another helpful resource is the &ldquo;<a href="http://washingtoncog.org/records-requests/public-records-act/" target="_blank" class="externallink">Public Records Act</a>&rdquo; web page from the <a href="http://www.washingtoncog.org" target="_blank" class="externallink">Washington Coalition for Open Government</a>, which provides links to RCWs, WACs, Attorney General Opinions, and a wealth of other related sources.</p>

    <dt>
        <p>Are library trustees required to take any training on public records?</p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>No. Although they  are required to have training on open public meetings, they are not required to  be trained on public records. However, a board&rsquo;s staff member or clerk who  posts meeting notices and agendas, and maintains minutes, may benefit from  training on the open public meetings requirements under the OPMA (Open Public Meetings Act).</p>

        <p>According to the <a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/Open-Government-resource-manual/Chapter-1" target="_blank" class="externallink">Open Government Resource Manual, Chapter 1</a>, &ldquo;The definition of a public record (other than a record of the Legislature) contains three elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&ldquo;&hellip; The record must be a writing&hellip;. A writing includes not only conventional letters and memoranda, but also emails, videos, photos and computer data.</li>
            <li>&ldquo;&hellip; The writing must relate to the conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function. Virtually every document a government agency has relates in some way to the conduct of government business or functions.</li>
            <li>&ldquo;&hellip; The writing must be either prepared, owned, used or retained by the agency. A writing may include data compiled for the issuance of a report (as well as the report itself), even though the agency had not intended to make the underlying data public.&rdquo;</li>

        <p>What about e-mails or documents related to agency business created by agency employees using their home computers, iPhones, or smart phones?</p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>As stated in <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=44-14-03001" target="_blank" class="externallink">WAC 44-14-03001</a>:</p>
        <p> &ldquo;Sometimes agency employees work on agency business from home computers. These home computer records (including e-mail) were &lsquo;used&rsquo; by the agency and relate to the &lsquo;conduct of government&rsquo; so they are &lsquo;public records.&rsquo; &hellip; However, the act does not authorize unbridled searches of agency property. If agency property is not subject to unbridled searches, then neither is the home computer of an agency employee. Yet, because the home computer documents relating to agency business are &quot;public records,&quot; they are subject to disclosure (unless exempt). Agencies should instruct employees that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees to keep agency-related documents on home computers in separate folders and to routinely blind carbon copy (&quot;bcc&quot;) work e-mails back to the employee's agency e-mail account. If the agency receives a request for records that are solely on employees' home computers, the agency should direct the employee to forward any responsive documents back to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers.&rdquo;</p>

        <li>It confirms the date on which the record is requested;</li>
        <li>It clarifies what is being requested;</li>
        <li>It provides for identification of the requesting party, with address and telephone number;</li>
        <li>Having identifying and contact information will facilitate any requests for clarification by the agency of any ambiguous request and enables the agency to determine if a person has the right to a record that would normally be exempt.</li>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/Open-Government-resource-manual" target="_blank" class="externallink">Open Government Resource Manual</a> notes that some laws outside the PRA require written requests. <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=44-14-03006" target="_blank" class="externallink">WAC 44-14-03006</a> states that a request can be made by mail, e-mail, fax, or orally.

    <p>The WAC further states:</p>

    <p>An agency is not required under the Act to respond to questions or to furnish information that is not the subject of an identifiable public record.

    <ul>

        <li>The superior court must hold a hearing with notice to every person of interest and the library. After the hearing, the court may permit inspection or copying if it is found that the exemption is clearly unnecessary to protect the individual&rsquo;s right of privacy or any vital government function.

        </li>
        <li>The third party to whom the library record pertains may seek injunctive relief to enjoin disclosure of the record. The action may be filed in the superior court where the person resides or where the record is maintained. The library may notify persons named in a record, or to whom a record pertains, that the record is subject to a pending record request under the Act.

    <p>Has the USA PATRIOT Act overturned all state laws protecting the confidentiality of library records?</p>
</dt>
<dd>
    <p>The Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF) of the American Library Association (ALA) includes the following response on their web page, <a href="http://www.ala.org/advocacy/advleg/federallegislation/theusapatriotact" target="_blank" class="externallink">FAQ: USA PATRIOT Act</a>:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;No, the state privacy laws regarding privacy in libraries are still in force, including laws protecting the confidentiality of library records. However, as federal laws, the provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), and the statute authorizing National Security Letters can supersede state privacy laws. It is important to remember, however, that state and local law enforcement agencies remain subject to state library confidentiality laws and other laws protecting privacy, and that even the FBI is still required to present a form of judicial process (court order or subpoena) before information can be turned over to the agency. Libraries should consult with their legal counsel to determine precisely under what circumstances their state's library confidentiality law permits the release of user information.&rdquo;</p>
