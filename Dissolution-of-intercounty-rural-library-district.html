<p>An informal AGO Opinion issued 9/1/1960, signed by Assistant Attorney General Herbert H. Fuller and addressed to Prosecuting Attorney Byron E. McClanahan, states:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;The statute does not require that the petition be signed by ten percent of voters of each county comprising the district but merely ten percent or more of the voters within the entire district. Thus, it is possible that the number of signatures necessary to place the proposition on the ballot could be secured within either one of the two counties concerned, and the requirements of the statute would be met.&rdquo;</blockquote>
