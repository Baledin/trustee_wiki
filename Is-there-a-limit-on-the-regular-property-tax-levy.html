<p>Yes. Article VII, Section 2 of the <a href="http://leg.wa.gov/LawsAndAgencyRules/Pages/constitution.aspx" target="_blank" class="externallink">Washington State Constitution</a> limits the regular property tax levy on real and personal property to 1% of its &ldquo;true and fair value,&rdquo; or $10.00 per $1,000 of assessed valuation (e.g., $1,000 for a $100,000 home). This is the combined rate for all units of government (state, county, and special districts), but excludes voted levies, such as school special levies and bond issues.</p>
