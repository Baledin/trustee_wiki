<p>An informal AGO Opinion issued 12/14/2009, signed by Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey T. Even and addressed to State Senator Mike Hewitt, states:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;A code city may contract with a library district for a different range of library services than the library district provides within its own boundaries.&hellip;A code city and a library district may negotiate a mutually agreeable contract under which the library district would operate a library within the code city, that provides a range of library services that is less than the range of services that the district provides within its own boundaries. The negotiated cost of the services would not have to be based on the library district&apos;s current property tax levy rate.&rdquo;
