<p><a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/ago-opinions/disposition-surplus-library-district-property" target="_blank" class="externallink">AGO Opinion AGLO 1974 No. 101</a> states that although a library district does not have the general power to sell its property, that "&hellip; does not mean, however, that when property is no longer needed for public use by such a district, it cannot be disposed of in some appropriate manner. &hellip; Indeed it would appear to be quite 'necessary for the orderly and efficient management and control of the library' for its board of trustees to have some mechanism for disposing of property it no longer needs. The intergovernmental disposition of property act, <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=39.33" target="_blank" class="externallink">chapter RCW 39.33</a> provides one such mechanism, but it is entirely possible for the trustees to devise other mechanisms which would comply with the law regarding disposition of surplus property. It is our opinion, therefore, that a library district does have the power to sell its surplus property&hellip;. To this extent, <a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/ago-opinions/library-board-no-power-sell-property-or-transfer-title-state-library-need-not-pay" target="_blank" class="externallink">AGO 1954 No. 233</a> should be deemed modified."</p>
