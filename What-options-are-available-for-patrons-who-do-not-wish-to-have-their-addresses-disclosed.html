<p>If a patron registering for a card does not want to give us their address on the grounds that they are victims of domestic violence, you may refer them to the Address Confidentiality Program for Victims of Domestic Violence in the State of Washington.</p>
<p>Under the auspices of the Office of the Secretary of State in Olympia, the ACP can help keep such a person's home, work, or school address secret (to satisfy the patron's desires) and give them a substitute mailing address and forward first-class mail from that address (to satisfy the library's needs).</p>
<ol>
    <li>Refer the patron to the ACP (if they wish to take advantage of this program):
        <address>Washington State Address Confidentiality Program<br />
            PO Box 257<br />
            Olympia, WA 98507-0069<br />
            1-800-822-1065</address>
    </li>
    <li>Issue a library card when the patron presents the laminated ACP card with the substitute address.</li>
</ol>
