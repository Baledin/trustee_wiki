  <dt>Is the library under an obligation to follow a No Trespass Order between the library's landlord and a third party?</dt>
<dd>From <a href="http://www.mrsc.org" target="_blank" class="externallink">Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington</a>:
    <blockquote>"Based on our understanding of the facts, the library is not a party to the No Trespass Order, so they should have no duty to ensure that the order is enforced. Indeed, it is probably best for the library <em>not</em> to be involved in the dispute between the landlord and <nowiki>[third party]</nowiki>. Unless or until (1) the <nowiki>[third party]</nowiki> cause issues with the library directly, or (2) the landlord formally involves the library, the library should continue to conduct its business as usual."</blockquote>

    <dt>May a library board send requests to the community to support library-related election measures?</dt>
    <dd>As per the <a href="https://www.pdc.wa.gov/" target="_blank">Public Disclosure Commission</a>:
        <blockquote>A library board may submit such requests as long as <strong>no library</strong> resources were used; i.e. no library computers to send the message, and no official letterhead. Advocacy should be done from personal computers on personal time.</blockquote>
