<p>Library boards are ultimately responsible for assuring that federal and state laws are reflected in library policies and procedures and that the constitutional rights of individuals are protected. This chapter, although by no means comprehensive, provides a brief overview of some state and federal laws that relate to public libraries. Assistance may be available from state and federal agencies through their print publications and web sites, as well as in-person workshops and webinars. The Washington State Library is a depository for both Washington State and Federal publications. Visit our <a href="http://www.sos.wa.gov/library/StateDepositoryProgram.aspx" target="_blank" class="externallink">Washington State Government Publications</a> and <a href="http://www.sos.wa.gov/library/FederalDepositoryProgram.aspx" target="_blank" class="externallink">Federal Government Resources</a> web sites for further information or search our <a href="http://www.sos.wa.gov/library/catalog.aspx" target="_blank" class="externallink">catalog</a> for items in these collections. Specific questions should be addressed to your library's legal counsel.</p>

<h3 class="separator">Revised Code of Washington (RCW)</h3>
<p>As described on the Washington State Legislature web site:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;The <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw" target="_blank" class="externallink">Revised Code of Washington (RCW)</a> is the compilation of all permanent laws now in force. It is a collection of Session Laws (enacted by the Legislature, and signed by the Governor, or enacted via the initiative process), arranged by topic, with amendments added and repealed laws removed. It does not include temporary laws such as appropriations acts. The official version of the RCW is published by the <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/pages/statute_law_committee.aspx" target="_blank" class="externallink">Statute Law Committee</a> and the <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/" target="_blank" class="externallink">Code Reviser</a>.</p>
    <p>The online version of the RCW is updated twice a year, once in the early fall following the legislative session, and again at the end of the year if a ballot measure that changes the law passed at the general election. Copies of the RCW as they existed each year since 2002 are available in the <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/RCWArchive/" target="_blank" class="externallink">RCW Archive</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="separator">Washington Administrative Code (WAC)</h3>
<p>The web site of the Washington State Legislature provides the following description of the <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/" target="_blank" class="externallink">WAC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Regulations of executive branch agencies are issued by authority of statutes. Like legislation and the Constitution, regulations are a source of primary law in Washington State. The WAC codifies the regulations and arranges them by subject or agency. The online version of the WAC is updated twice a month. Copies of the WAC as they existed each year since 2004 are available in the <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/WACArchive" target="_blank" class="externallink">WAC archive</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Federal laws that are of particular relevance to libraries include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm" target="_blank" class="externallink">Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)</a> (including changes made by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-325)<br />
        The U.S. Department of Justice <a href="http://www.ada.gov" target="_blank" class="externallink">ADA Home Page</a> provides numerous links related to the ADA, including the <em><a href="http://www.ada.gov/2010ADAstandards_index.htm" target="_blank" class="externallink">2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design</a></em> and the <em><a href="http://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/toolkitmain.htm" target="_blank" class="externallink">ADA Best Practices Tool Kit for State and Local Governments</a></em> &ldquo;&hellip; to assist state and local officials to improve compliance with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in their programs, services, activities, and facilities.&rdquo;
        <dl>
            <dt>What process can be used to define reasonable accomodation under ADA?</dt>
            <dd>According to MRSC:
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that state and local governments give individuals with disabilities and their immediate relations an equal opportunity to benefit from all of their programs, services, and activities. Note, however, that public entities are not required to take actions that would result in undue financial and administrative burdens. They are required to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures where necessary to avoid discrimination, unless they can demonstrate that doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity being provided. (See <a href="https://www.ada.gov/t2hlt95.htm" target="_blank" class="externallink">Title II Highlights</a> and the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/taman2.html#II-5.2000" target="_blank" class="externallink">Title II Technical Assistance Manual</a>).</p>
                    <p>The State of Washington also has a law prohibiting discrimination against people with disabilities called the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD) at <a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=49.60" target="_blank" class="externallink">chapter 49.60 RCW</a>. In <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/wa-court-of-appeals/1741656.html" target="_blank" class="externallink"><em>Hartleben v. University of Washington</em></a>, 194 Wn. App. 877 (2016), the court held that allowing a disabled student to attend school free of tuition would fundamentally alter the university's business model, therefore the student did not qualify for accommodation under the WLAD.</p>
                    <blockquote>&ldquo;When an accommodation would fundamentally alter a service, it is not reasonable. Here, the University provides classes in exchange for payment of tuition. Providing classes without collecting tuition fundamentally alters its business model.&rdquo;</blockquote>
                    <p><em>Id.</em> at 890. Under each of these laws, I think it would be a reasonable position for the library to say that a child running around the library interfering with other patrons who are attempting to utilize the library's services would fundamentally alter the service being offered by the library. Libraries provide a free, quiet place to get work done without interference, and allowing a child to run around unmonitored fundamentally alters that service.</p>
                    <p>You did mention that there may be a conference room with Wi-Fi available. If the library is able, it could work with the patron to designate a time for him to come in and utilize a laptop computer for a certain amount of time in the conference room. Also, you could advise the library that if this patron visits again and cites the ADA as requiring accommodation, the library could ask the person to make a reasonable accommodation request in writing, and then the library could develop an appropriate response at that time.</p>
                    <p>While MRSC can provide general guidance on this subject, the ADA is not an area of expertise. The U.S. Department of Justice maintains an <a href="https://www.ada.gov/infoline.htm" target="_blank" class="externallink">Info Line</a> (800-514-0301) for ADA Compliance. It may be worth calling to discuss this issue with them. The <a href="http://www.hum.wa.gov/" target="_blank" class="externallink">Washington State Human Rights Commission</a> is responsible for enforcing the WLAD.</p>
