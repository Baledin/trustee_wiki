'''RCW 27.15.020 Request to establish library capital facility area â€” Ballot propositions.'''

Upon receipt of a completed written request to both establish a library capital facility area and submit a ballot proposition under RCW 27.15.050 to finance library capital facilities, that is signed by a majority of the members of the board of trustees of a library district or board of trustees of a city or town library, the county legislative authority or county legislative authorities for the county or counties in which a proposed library capital facility area is to be established shall submit separate ballot propositions to voters to authorize establishing the proposed library capital facility area and authorizing the library capital facility area, if established, to finance library capital facilities by issuing general indebtedness and imposing excess levies to retire the indebtedness. The ballot propositions shall be submitted to voters at a general or special election. If the proposed election date is not a general election, the county legislative authority is encouraged to request an election when another unit of local government with territory located in the proposed library capital facility area is already holding a special election under RCW 29.13.020. Approval of the ballot proposition to create a library capital facility area shall be by a simple majority vote.

     A completed request submitted under this section shall include: (1) A description of the boundaries of the library capital facility area; and (2) a copy of the resolution of the legislative authority of each city or town, and board of trustees of each library district, with territory included within the proposed library capital facility area indicating both: (a) Its approval of the creation of the proposed library capital facility area; and (b) agreement on how election costs will be paid for submitting ballot propositions to voters that authorize the library capital facility area to incur general indebtedness and impose excess levies to retire the general indebtedness.
